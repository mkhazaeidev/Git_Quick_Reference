Getting a Git Repository
    1- Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory:
        git init

    2- Cloning an Existing Repository:
        git clone <url>

        --example: git clone https://github.com/mkhazaeidev/Git_Quick_Reference.git

Checking the Status of Your Files:
    1- Comprehensive status:
        git status

    2- Short Status:
        git status -s
        git status --short

        --help:
            ??: Unmodified
            A: Added
            C: Copied
            D: Deleted
            M: Modified
            U: Updated but unmerged
            R: Renamed

            left-hand column: indicates the status of the staging area
            right-hand column: indicates the status of the working directory

            --example:
                 M: The file is modified in the working directory but not yet staged.
                M : The file is modified and staged.
                MM: The file was modified, staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.
